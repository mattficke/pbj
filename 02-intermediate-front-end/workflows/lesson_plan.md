# User Stories/MVP/Agile Software Development

## Learning Objectives
- Define SDLC and why we use it as developers.
- Provide a general overview of what "Agile" means and contrast it to Waterfall
- Identify the components of a good user story
- Explain what Trello is, and why we use it.
- define what a backlog is and how they are implemented in developer workflow
- Create user stories for existing web applications
- Differentiate MVP from application.
- Generate user stories in order to create proof of concept for MVP(minimum viable product)

## Opening Framing

What is mean to be a developer? Do we, as developers, just sit in our mom's basement, drinking mountain dew absent minded from the outside world and just code all day? Maybe. Hopefully not. Development is not just about coding. Planning, preparing, discussion and iteration is our lifeblood. It's integral to how effective development happens. Let's look at [facebook from 10 years ago](http://editorial.designtaxi.com/news-facebook050214/2.jpg). Now, let's look at facebook [now](http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA1LzI5LzIxLzIwMTB6dWNrLmQ0NGNiLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTg1MHg4NTA-CmUJanBn/461e20d3/dcf/2010zuck.jpg). Clearly these changes didn't happen overnight. Some serious planning and development methodologies went into this.

## SDLC
THE SDLC is the systems development life cycle, also referred to as the application development life-cycle. It is a term used to describe a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. We'll be talking about one model/methodology of SDLC in particular.

## Agile Software Development
*Official* wikipedia definition. Agile Software Development is a group of software development methods in which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams.

### Agile Manifesto
> Great Quote: "The Agile movement is not anti-methodology, in fact many of us want to restore credibility to the word methodology. We want to restore a balance. We embrace modeling, but not in order to file some diagram in a dusty corporate repository. We embrace documentation, but not hundreds of pages of never-maintained and rarely-used tomes. We plan, but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment. Those who would brand proponents of XP or SCRUM or any of the other Agile Methodologies as "hackers" are ignorant of both the methodologies and the original definition of the term hacker." â€”Jim Highsmith, History: The Agile Manifesto

<b>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:</b>
- self-organization and motivation are important, as are interactions like co-location and pair programming.

<b>Working software over comprehensive documentation:</b>
- working software is more useful and welcome than just presenting documents to clients in meetings.

<b>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:</b>
- requirements cannot be fully collected at the beginning of the software development cycle, therefore continuous customer or stakeholder involvement is very important.

<b>Responding to change over following a plan:</b>
- agile methods are focused on quick responses to change and continuous development.[11]n-profit organization that promotes software development according to the manifesto's values and principles.
